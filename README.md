## TL;DR

Traditional text and knowledge models analyze *flat projections* — patterns that appear when the rich, three-dimensional structure of facts and meanings is cast onto the surface of language.Even when these models use thousands of dimensions to describe those surfaces, what they explore remains essentially **the geometry of the shadow**, not the form of what casts it.  
**RIHU** takes a different approach: it aims to **approximate and reconstruct the underlying semantic structures** that language projects.
Instead of comparing texts within a flattened embedding space, RIHU builds an interpretable *coordinate system* in which facts and concepts appear as **points and regions** along explicit, human-readable axes.  
This shift — from analyzing the “map of shadows” to reasoning within the “space of meaning” — enables RIHU to describe not only *how close* things are, but also *in which direction and for what reason*.

## Relationship Between RIHU and KAG

| Concept                                           | Role                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KAG (Knowledge as Geometry)**                   | The *theoretical foundation* — defines how knowledge is represented as a geometric structure of HFs, Classes, and Instances. |
| **KAG Universe**                                  | The *operational space* constructed from KAG — the geometric manifold of meaning.                                            |
| **RIHU (Retrieval In the Hypothetical Universe)** | The *retrieval methodology* that moves through the KAG Universe to find, interpret, and contextualize knowledge.             |

Think of **KAG** as the *map of meaning* — and **RIHU** as the *navigator* exploring that map.

## Why KAG (and why RIHU)?

Traditional RAG systems retrieve by text similarity in a single embedding space.  
KAG differs fundamentally by introducing **geometry-first semantics** — explicit, interpretable coordinates of meaning.

RIHU builds on that geometry to enable **structured, contextual retrieval**.

* **Explicit axes** — e.g., time / space / semantics are treated as coordinate dimensions.
* **Classes with influence** — each Class has measurable presence across regions.
* **Subjective search** — retrieval can originate from a *vantage point*, not only from a text query.
* **Interpretable geometry** — anchor Classes stabilize the space and make positions meaningful.

---

## Core Concepts

KAG treats the world as a space **filled only with facts**.  
Since the totality of facts is **unknowable**, we work with **Hypothetical Facts (HFs)**—propositions **inferred** from observations, traces, or representations. KAG builds a **knowledge space** where HFs, **Instances**, and **Classes** are projected into a **uniform geometric model**.

### 1) Entities

* **Hypothetical Fact (HF)**
  An inferred, context-grounded proposition derived from observations or media.  
  *Example:* “**1776-07-04**: The **Declaration of Independence** was adopted in **Philadelphia**.”

* **Instance**
  A concrete occurrence of a Class *within a specific HF*. It identifies a **particular** concept/component *as observed inside that HF*.  
  *Example:* If “Declaration of Independence” appears in 5 HFs, there are **5 Instances** of that Class.

* **Class**
  The **unique** pattern that groups similar Instances across HFs. A Class is **one per concept**, and its Instances are the many.  
  *Example:* The Class **“Declaration of Independence”** is unique, even if it has many Instances.

* **Representation**
  A human-facing artifact (text, video, visualization, etc.) that we **extract HFs from**.  
  *Example:* A documentary synthesized from many HFs about the Declaration is a **Representation**.

> **Uniformity Principle**
> **Time** and **Place** are modeled **as Classes and Instances** just like any other concept. This removes schema-driven bias and lets every kind of information be treated **flatly** in the same geometry.


### 2) Knowledge Space & Projection

KAG constructs a **knowledge space** where HFs and their constituent Instances are embedded. Classes are **projected** as the shared structures that tie Instances together.

* Each HF anchors a **local configuration** of Instances (people, events, artifacts, times, places…).  
* Each Class summarizes **where** and **how** its Instances appear across HFs.  
* Representations are **inputs** to extraction; we do not directly reason over them as truth—only via the HFs they yield.

* **Class is unique; Instances are many.**
  A Class exists **once**; each appearance **per HF** is a distinct Instance.
* **HF coordinates = Instance coordinates.**
  An Instance **inherits** the coordinates of the HF it appears in. Thus, a Class’s position emerges from the **distribution** of its Instances across HFs.

> **Why “Hypothetical”?**
> **A complete and omniscient capture of all facts is never feasible.**
> HFs make this explicit: we reason from **what is observed and inferred**, not from a claim of total knowledge.


### 3) Coordinates & Axes (Choosing the Frame)

The knowledge space is given coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^D$. Axes are **broad abstractions of Classes** that provide continuity and coverage:

1. **Axis from Class abstractions**
   Use abstractions like **Location**, **Organization**, **Time**, **Discipline** when the observer or data suggests them.
2. **Continuity & Connectivity**
   Prefer axes that relate to **many Classes** and exhibit **smooth variation** (e.g., time is continuous and widely presupposed).
3. **Inclusion**
   Favor axes whose related Classes **contain** many others (i.e., “large” Classes that organize others).

> **Anchors**
> Concrete, interpretable Classes (e.g., historical periods, cities, known entities) can be used as **anchors** to stabilize the frame. Axes can be proposed or initialized with LLM assistance, while preserving interpretability.


### 4) Examples

* **Event HF:**
  “**1776-07-04**: **Declaration of Independence** adopted in **Philadelphia**.”  
  Includes Instances of Classes: *18th century*, *Declaration of Independence*, *Philadelphia*, *United States*.

* **Relational HF:**
  “One week before **XX**, **A** and **B** conversed at **C**.”  
  Includes Instances of Classes: *A*, *B*, *C (place)*, *time offset*, *XX (reference event)*.

* **Representation:**
  A documentary compiled from HFs about the Declaration is a **Representation**. We extract HFs **from** it; we do not equate the narrative with ground truth.


### 5) What the Geometry Buys Us

Because all elements—including time and place—are **Classes and Instances in one flat space**, we can compute **interpretable** geometric properties:

* **Nearness** ⇒ *aboutness / relatedness*
* **Density** ⇒ *salience / influence*
* **Containment** ⇒ *context / framing*

These properties feed downstream metrics (e.g., centroids, enclosing volumes, power) and enable **RIHU** to perform retrieval as **wayfinding** inside this geometric knowledge space.

## The KAG Universe: Coordinate System

All knowledge is embedded into $\mathbb{R}^D$, where axes represent broad, continuous dimensions (e.g., time / space / semantics).  
Each **HF** is located within this coordinate system according to the structure of Classes and Instances that define it.

### Good axes: choosing and defining the frame

Good axes are those that preserve interpretability and continuity, providing stable reference for HF positioning.

Good axes:

1. Are abstractions of Classes (e.g., “location”, “organization”, “time”).
2. Connect many other Classes with continuity.
3. Provide large, interpretable “containers” of meaning.

**Anchor Classes** (like time bins or known locations) stabilize the coordinate frame via regularization and alignment.

> In practice, **axes and anchors can also be suggested or initialized by large language models (LLMs)** —
> for example, by inferring temporal, spatial, or semantic structures from text or datasets.
> This allows partial automation of Universe construction while maintaining geometric interpretability.

---

## Universe Construction

> The **Universe** in KAG corresponds to what a traditional RAG system would call an **index** — the structured space in which knowledge is stored and retrieved.
> However, rather than a static vector index, KAG uses the term *Universe* to emphasize its **geometric and dynamic nature**:
> a manifold of Hypothetical Facts, Classes, and Instances, whose relationships are explicitly modeled as geometry.

The following section outlines how these geometric ideas are implemented concretely in RIHU’s Python prototype.

1. **Propose axes** (LLM, single call, **K in [3,10]**; if `dims` is unset, the working dimensionality defaults to K and is later clamped to the available embedding rank and sample count).
2. **Propose axis bins** (LLM, per axis, **3–7 discrete bins**) — short, interpretable patterns (label/description/prototypes) along each continuous axis.
3. **Extract HFs & Classes** (LLM-assisted with fallbacks).
4. **Merge near-duplicates**
   4.1 **Mechanical merge** (name normalization + alias consolidation).
   4.2 **Embedding-based blocking** to propose candidate class pairs → **auto-merge high-confidence pairs**, **LLM disambiguation** for ambiguous pairs.
   4.3 *(Optional)* **LLM consolidation** over remaining Classes.
5. **Initial coordinates** via text embeddings + **SVD projection** to **D** dimensions (D chosen per step 1 and **clamped** to embedding rank / sample count).
6. *(Optional)* **Anchor targets & one-shot affine alignment** — LLM proposes target coordinates for anchors within a bounded range; solve a single affine map; **anchors remain fixed** thereafter.
7. **Iterative relaxation** (HFs → class centroids; classes → instance-HF centroids; **anchors do not move**).
8. **Scale normalization** — **prefer anchors** when available; otherwise use all classes.
9. **Metrics** — centroid / radius (enclosing-ball approx) / volume / power.
10. **Axis-bin interpretability scoring** — embed HF/class signatures vs. bin prototypes to record per-axis soft memberships and top-bin labels for HFs and Classes.

---

## Geometry & Metrics

For any Class (A), using the coordinates of its Instances:

1. **Position** (centroid): the mean of Instance coordinates
   $\mathbf{c}\_A = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{x}\_i$
2. **Influence Range**: a simply connected region containing all Instances (approximated by the **minimal enclosing ball**); $radius (r_A)$.
3. **Volume** (in (D) dimensions):
   $V_A = V_D(1)\cdot r_A^D,\quad V_D(1)=\frac{\pi^{D/2}}{\Gamma(D/2+1)}$
4. **Power**:
   $\text{power}(A)=\frac{\text{Instances}(A)}{V_A}$
  
### Contextual Relationships

* If an HF lies inside a Class’s influence region, that Class is contextual for the HF.  
* If Class A lies within Class B’s influence region, A is subordinate to B (B provides the contextual frame).

## RIHU Retrieval in the KAG Universe

RIHU treats retrieval as **navigation through the KAG Universe**.  
Instead of asking *“Which texts match?”*, we ask: **“Where should I stand in the geometry — and what becomes near, dense, or enclosing when I do?”**

RIHU supports two complementary retrieval modes:

* **Objective Retrieval (world-centric)** — search from the global structure of meaning.  
* **Subjective Retrieval (observer-centric)** — search from a specific vantage within the space.

### 1) Objective Retrieval

**Intent:**
Discover what the world “knows” about a topic, by locating regions where relevant Classes or HFs converge.

**Conceptual flow:**

1. **Determine the reference coordinates** — either  
   (a) identify the position (or centroid) of the target HF or Class by reference search (optionally using text-based vector retrieval within HFs), or  
   (b) estimate the position of the target information within the Universe using the same placement method applied to HFs.  
2. **Define the conceptual nucleus** — select key Classes or conceptual anchors (e.g., *Declaration of Independence*, *United States*).  
3. **Compute the centroid** — calculate the geometric center of these reference coordinates in the Universe.  
4. **Survey the neighborhood** — identify nearby HFs or regions with overlapping Class memberships.  
5. **Interpret density** — dense regions imply high influence or conceptual richness.


### 2) Subjective Retrieval

**Intent:** Explore the world **from within** — from the viewpoint of an observer in the KAG Universe.

**Conceptual flow:**

1. **Pick a vantage point** — select a coordinate in the observer space, using existing Classes (person, role, moment) as reference points.  
2. **Look around** — retrieve nearby HFs within a certain radius.  
3. **Identify context** — Classes enclosing the observer define the ambient context.  
4. **Scan the periphery** — what lies just beyond reach, signaling emerging relevance?

**Design principles:**

* **Context-first retrieval** — the “room” around the observer matters.  
* **Periphery awareness** — sense the nearby unknown.  
* **Bias transparency** — by declaring a vantage, bias becomes explicit.


### 3) Detective Search (Prototype — Not Yet Implemented)

**Intent:**
Infer **unobserved or hypothetical facts** by reasoning through the geometric relationships of known Classes — searching not for what *is*, but for what *must be*, given the structure of the Universe.

**Conceptual flow:**

1. **Identify involved Classes** — determine which Classes are likely to participate in the unseen fact (e.g., *detective*, *crime scene*, *witness*).  
2. **Estimate the geometric barycenter** — compute the centroid of these Classes’ coordinates to hypothesize the most probable region for the missing Hypothetical Fact (HF).  
3. **Survey nearby evidence** — collect related Classes, adjacent HFs, and contextual information within that region.  
4. **Invoke generative reasoning** — provide these collected elements (Classes, HFs, Context) to a generative model to infer the *most plausible unobserved fact*.

**Philosophical intent:**

* *Inference as retrieval* — the act of “searching” extends to reasoning about the unseen.  
* *Geometry as hypothesis space* — positional relationships suggest what *ought to exist*, even if not yet observed.  
* *Generative triangulation* — large language models act as geometric interpreters, connecting partial evidence into coherent hypothetical facts.


### Choosing a Mode

* Use **Objective RIHU** for top-down, phenomenon-centric exploration.  
* Use **Subjective RIHU** for bottom-up, observer-centric interpretation.  
* Mix both: locate the global neighborhood first, then experience it from within.

## Why this matters for RAG

RIHU reframes retrieval for **explainable semantic navigation**:

| Geometric property | Meaning                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Distance**       | Aboutness (near = relevant)             |
| **Density**        | Salience (many Instances = influential) |
| **Containment**    | Context (inside = framing meaning)      |

Retrieval becomes **legible**: you can literally *point to the region* in the KAG Universe where meaning was found.
